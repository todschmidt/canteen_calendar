CEDAR MOUNTAIN CANTEEN announces Community Storytelling on Friday, September 26 from 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm a year after Helene. Share your stories of love and community resilience.  There will be a potluck dinner too.

 

As we near the one year anniversary of Hurricane Helene we hold in our hearts the love and community we experienced and continue to experience.  The Canteen would not be open if it wasn’t for all the volunteer labor, help and donations our community provided and continues to provide.  We still have a lot to do to get back to where we were.  We want to take a moment and celebrate how far we have come in the past year because of our community.

 

We are hosting an evening of storytelling on September 26th and a community potluck.  We will be recording the stories and will share them on our Canteen TV station.  Please join us and share your story and listen to others as we celebrate the strength and love of our precious village.  With deep gratitude, The Cedar Mountain Canteen, an employee-owned cooperative

 

The Canteen is currently featuring the art of Cathryn Cooper. Cathryn works with collage on paper and canvas using assorted materials to create elaborate mixed media pieces. Her inspiration is derived from found objects, combining them as totems in collage.

 

More recently, returning to her roots of drawing, she is inspired by the light in North Carolina mountain landscapes. Her most recent work combines acrylic painting and graphite drawing.

 

The Canteen is fortunate to be showcasing Cathryn’s art. She has been chosen as the featured artist for the year’s Brevard Plein Air Festival.

 

CEDAR MOUNTAIN ROTARY CLUB MEETING 

This month the club meeting will be on the second and third Monday, September 8th and September 15th. We will be meeting at the Cedar Mountain Community Center at 5:30 PM on September 8th. We are fortunate to have Mary Freudenberg, president of the Transylvania County Bird Club as our speaker for the meeting. The annual migration of birds that pass through Transylvania County is beginning. I am sure Mary can tell us a lot about the birds we can expect to see pass through on their flight South for their winter vacation. A potluck meal will follow the meeting. Hope to see you there.  Our address is 10630-10640 Greenville Highway in Cedar Mountain.

 

CEDAR MTN FIRE/RESCUE AUXILIARY BBQ

AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young

I labored on Labor Day.  I’ve been working pulling weeds and unwanted plant life from my Mossary and it is a big job.  The area in front of the porch has been so badly neglected I can’t even pull out some of the “volunteer” trees.  Some have trunks on them.  I’ve finished about half the project and what I’ve done looks great.   I have balance issues and have to sit on the ground to groom the moss.  I just hope I can finish it before fall weather sets in.  Where did summer go anyway?
