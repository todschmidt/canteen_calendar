### Cedar Mountain Canteen

Monday July 30th Owen Grooms Presents Mark and Sally Wingate

## Hours

We have new hours for Tuesday when we will be opening at 12:30 pm and closing at
7pm. And on Saturdays we will be closing at 8pm on nights when we don't have
music (I assume)

 ## Story Corps

 For months we have been hosting the John Lewis book club using his book Carry
 On.  The book is full of chapters that range in length from half a page to 5
 pages.  We spent time talking about topics and hearing each others stories.  As
 a group we agreed we would love to hear more stories from those in our
 community.  Also, we now have a live streaming “TV station” and have the
 expertise and equipment to capture and share stories.

We are using the DIY StoryCorps guidance as we navigate the project and we are
at the point of training where we are asked to assemble our team.  So we are.
Are you interested in being a part of the team?   Please let us know.  You can
email us at LittleEddyLLC@gmail.com.

We look forward to growing together.
