Coming up on Monday, July 22nd, from 12 to 2 PM, the Cedar Mountain Canteen is hosting a free live-stream art class — and you're invited to join in, either online or in person!

The class will be led by Arianna, one of the Canteen's own bartenders and the artist behind White Wolf Stone Creations. Whether you're tuning in from home or painting at the Canteen, it's a great chance to get creative and unwind.

Here's what you’ll need:

A canvas — any kind will do! Feel free to upcycle something like an old piece of wood.

Acrylic paints in red, blue, yellow, white, and black

A palette and various paintbrush sizes

An easel if you have one, though a table works just fine. They'll even have a few easels available on-site.

Again, it’s totally free — just bring your supplies and get ready to paint!

That’s Monday, July 22nd, 12 to 2 PM — don't miss it!

Also, Monday, July 21st will be an album release for Brian Vanatwerp & Friends for his album "Songs for kids (suitable for all)"
