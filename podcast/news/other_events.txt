Update on Storm Debris Status in Transylvania County
BREVARD, NC- In July, Transylvania County Commissioners is partnering with North Carolina Emergency Management on the remaining Helene debris removal needs for the county under the SMART program. SMART has secured contractors to begin debris removal. Last week, FEMA completed site assessments and provided determinations for the Private Property Debris Sites in the County.
Private Property Debris Removal Update:
FEMA provided the following criteria for eligibility for debris removal activities, such as clearance, removal, and disposal, are eligible if the removal is in the public interest based on whether the work:
• Eliminates immediate threats to lives, public health, and safety.
• Eliminates immediate threats of significant damage to improved public or private property (Note- forested areas on private property with debris down from the storm generally do not qualify for PPDR under these rules)
A total of (412) application packets were submitted in Transylvania County with the US Army Corps of Engineer’s Contractor. Representatives from USACE and FEMA conducted site visits at the end of August. The applications and site information were reviewed for eligibility by FEMA with (212) being deemed eligible or eligible with conditions.
Eligible or eligible with conditions
The (25) properties deemed eligible will be contacted by the SMART program contractor at least (72) hours before work will commence on their property. The contractor will begin work in Transylvania County later this week.
The (187) properties deemed eligible with conditions. According to FEMA this means they are properties that have eligible debris, but also debris that the photos supplied in the application and site visit are not clear enough, or do not adequately identify a hazard or impact to the property to make a full eligibility decision. In this situation, additional information will be required.
