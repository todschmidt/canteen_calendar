SHERWOOD FOREST FRIENDS SUMMER SERIES.
Discover unique aspects of our region’s economy and culture at Sherwood Forest Friends Summer Series. The annual event will kick off on Saturday, July 19 with Gaia Herbs: Soil to Supplement. Free admission! Gather with friends and neighbors in the Robin Hood Barn at 7 p.m. when Kate Renner, the Director of Farm Operations at Gaia Herbs will dig into the history of the Gaia farm and its evolution.  Since 1997, Gaia Herbs has been rooted in the history of Transylvania County, as one of its largest employers and as an agricultural land steward of 350 acres. Discover what inspired Gaia Herbs to become the first and only Regenerative Organic Certified™ farm in the Carolinas and the many ways migrant farm crews have made farm operations possible over the decades. 
This year, in addition to raffle baskets, there will be a silent auction for a variety of artwork and experiences.  Wine and water will be available for a donation beginning at 6:30 p.m.   Proceeds from beverage sales, the raffle, and auction benefit the Allikas Scholarship, given annually to an organization that advances environmental education or preservation of the arts in our area.

FAITH MEMORIAL CHAPEL welcomes folks of all denominations to our services, held on Sundays at 11:00 AM.  We meet only in the summer and have no membership roll, so you won’t feel like a guest.  Each Sunday, we have clergy from different churches that visit us to lead the service and we are blessed to also have great music to accompany the great message!


On July 20th, we welcome The Rev. Kyle Matthews. Kyle is the Minister of Worship Arts at First Baptist Church, Greenville, SC and the owner of See for Yourself Music, a small company that publishes his music and manages his concerts and speaking engagements.  


This Sunday, we also welcome Rudy Polk as our soloist. Rudy is a tenor vocalist from Clinton, Mississippi with considerable achievements as a young musician. Rudy is currently a junior studying vocal performance at the University of North Texas.


ROCKY HILL BAPTIST Vacation Bible School will begin this Sunday, July 20 at Rocky Hill Baptist Church at 6:00 pm.  Please join us for three days of worship and fun through music, Bible character reenactments, crafts, food and recreation.  Children ages four through middle school are invited to attend.  For more information contact Patty Stahl at 885-2498.

Greetings, neighbors and friends.
 Our July potluck on Sunday the 20th will feature a program by one of our neighbors.  Amy Freeman will tell us more about Community Action Opportunities and Life Works an important program that she runs in Transylvania County.  Life Works takes a holistic approach to self-sufficiency, working with participants and their families across various aspects of their lives.  They help individuals obtain full-time, living wage jobs so they can move out of poverty and obtain economic security.  Participants are typically in the program one to three years.  During this time, they work with their Life Works Coach, setting goals and addressing barriers while focusing on education/training and financial capabilities. 


Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join with us.  Just bring your dish to share at 5:30 pm and we’ll socialize for a bit before eating at 6:00 pm.  Watt McCain and Susan Hindman will be our hosts (thanks, folks).  Bring your own utensils if you are of a mind to do so – it reduces our contributions to the landfill
 
The Transylvania 2050 Comprehensive Plan Update has entered its next phase and is asking for community feedback. I’ve attached a flyer about the Transylvania 2050 Community Survey (www.transylvaniacounty.org/2050communitysurvey).  The Survey will be open at least through the end of July.  Please use it to provide your inputs to the planning process for our county’s next 25 year.  Remember that priorities and funding for things we want in the future is based on what gets into the plan now.

AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young
I’m getting serious about weeds and undesirable plants in the front yard.  Most of the yard is ferns and moss including absolute forest of Maidenhair ferns but the area right in front is supposed to be Hostas and little more.  I planted a native whose name I don’t recall, but it is very invasive.  I’d spray them but don’t want to harm desirables.  So I have to sit on the ground and pull weeds.  I’m a picky weeder so it takes a lot of time.  Last Wednesday my left eyebrow met a bench when I tripped over a hose.  I am keeping a low profile until this shiner goes away.
