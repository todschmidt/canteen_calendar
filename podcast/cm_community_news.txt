CEDAR MOUNTAIN NEWS FOR 9-11-25

TRANSYLVANIA SHARES FREE REPAIR CAFE
Are you skilled at fixing things? We need your help to staff our repair clinic! Everything we do is free and volunteer-based. We’re ready to mend clothing, fix sewing machines, and repair household appliances, furniture, and tools. Whether you have a broken blender or skills with a screwdriver, the WNC Repair Cafe is all about neighbors helping neighbors and reducing waste.
The Cedar Mountain Canteen and Transylvania Shares have teamed up with WNC Repair Cafe to bring fix-it clinics to Transylvania County. Our first clinic will be held on Saturday, September 20th from 4:30 to 7:30pm at the Cedar Mountain Canteen. There are no reservations.  You just show up.  Please come to the potluck as well. 
We’re looking for volunteers who can repair furniture, tools, and appliances, as well as those who can sew and mend. If you have the skills and are willing to donate your time, we’d love to hear from you. We need a local community of fixers, and we know you’re out there.
Having a good ratio of volunteers to participants is key to a successful event, and we welcome volunteers of all skill levels. If you’re interested in helping out, please email Transylvania Shares at TransylvaniaShares@gmail.com. Thank you for being part of this effort. Everything on this earth is incredibly valuable—nothing is disposable!

We would like to take this opportunity to hear from you about how you would like the CMCC to better serve our residents.  We have a short Survey for the CMCC website that we would like everyone to complete; it only takes a few minutes!

AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young
Last Friday my honey paid a visit to Transylvania Regional Hospital via ambulance and was transferred to Mission on Saturday morning.  They are doing a batter of tests and he is still awaiting an MRI as of Tuesday.  He had what might have been a TIA but that has not been determined.  More later. 
I apologize if I missed using anyone’s news.
