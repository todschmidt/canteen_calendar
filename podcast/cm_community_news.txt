CEDAR MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY CENTER

Our Thanksgiving Potluck dinner will be held on Tuesday November 11th. Dishes to share need to be on the table by 6:15 pm, and dinner begins at 6:30 pm. Turkey and ham will be provided, so please bring your favorite dish or dessert. Join us as we celebrate with friends and neighbors during this season of thankfulness.

 

The Cedar Mountain Community Center would like to thank everyone for making our BBQ fundraiser a great success. We sold out to the last ounce of food. There was a lot of visiting with friends and neighbors. Fun was had by all, but the best thing was the BBQ and fixings from Smoke on BBQ.

 

CEDAR MOUNTAIN CANTEEN

Join us at the Cedar Mountain Canteen Friday, October 24 from 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm for storytelling around the campfire with Smores.  This is the third installment of our storytelling Fridays and this one's theme is folklore. Join us as we explore the shadowy corners of the known world, share ghost stories, and weave some tall tales.  All are welcome.  Costumes are encouraged.

AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young

I am doing some “spring” housework by donating excess items that we don’t use.  We combined two households in 2021 and still need to eliminate duplicates.  It is difficult to get rid of favorites for both of us.  My honey has his favorite cookware and I have mine.  There is no budging on that.  So when my “chef” cooks he uses his and vise versa.  He is a pretty good cook so I don’t mind.  It just takes up so much room in our little pantry.

I’ve started bringing house in plants that have spent the summer outside.  My Christmas cactus is in bloom.  I guess it doesn’t realize it’s only October.
