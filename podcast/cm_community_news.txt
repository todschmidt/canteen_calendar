CONGRATULATIONS 
Marianne Plunkert, a resident of Sequoyah Woods, has been chosen to participate in the Louisville Book Festival on Saturday, October 11, 2025, at the Kentucky International Convention Center. 
Founded in 2018, this non-profit event aims to celebrate and promote reading, writing, and literacy. At the festival, Marianne will sign copies of her newly released historical romance, What Might Have Been. The novel, published by The Wild Rose Press, is inspired by the rich history of Denver, Colorado, which she discovered while living and working there, fulfilling her lifelong dream of publication. 
Set in 1864 during the Civil War and Indian uprisings, the story follows Melissa Sullivan, who flees a lecherous uncle by stowing away in a wagon bound for the Colorado Territory. She soon encounters its owner, a high-handed Union army lieutenant escaping his own troubles. Upon arriving in Denver, Melissa faces limited options as significant historical events, including the Sand Creek Massacre, unfold around her. One reader described the book as “a perfect blend of history and romance.”

RENT THE CENTER

AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young
	Tod, who hosts the Cedar Mountain News on the Cedar Mountain Canteen TV Show is currently repairing our pressure washer. He's skilled in many areas and even volunteered at the recent Repair Cafe. Our machine needed more work than expected, so he still has it, but he kindly lent us his in the meantime. I've been putting it to good use, and though and I got soaked to the skin.  The handicap ramp, walkway, and decking look much better now. There's still a lot more to do, but Tod has made it all possible so far. Many thanks, Tod!
