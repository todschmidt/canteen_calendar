AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young
My honey labored all day long Saturday for the Cook-Off.  He used a recipe from his Emeril Lagasse Gumbo recipe from his massive cookbook collection.  It was hot and ready for the tasting but sadly he didn’t get any votes.   However Terie Girolamos son raved about the Gumbo as being true New Orleans style Gumbo and he loved it.  However said he voted for his mom as did I.  She won first place.  My honey was pleased with the praise from someone who appreciated his efforts.  We do have a lot of Gumbo leftover to eat though.  Ha.
