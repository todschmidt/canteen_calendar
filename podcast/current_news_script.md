# Cedar Mountain Community Podcast Script for 08-14-2025

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Cedar Mountain Community Podcast. I'm your host, Tod Schmidt
We've got some great events and news to share from our beautiful mountain 
Community so let's dive into what's happening around Cedar Mountain.

## Cedar Mountain Community News

### Hunger Coalition Monthly Food Distribution Sites
The Hunger Coalition provides monthly food distribution at various locations:

**1st Thursday** - Old GO Grocery parking lot (1232 Asheville Hwy), 2:30 to 4:00 PM

**2nd Thursday** - Rosman Town Hall Pavilions, 2:30 to 4:00 PM

**3rd Thursday** - Cedar Mountain Community Center, 2:30 to 4:00 PM

**4th Thursday** - Quebec Community Center, 2:30 to 4:00 PM

### Faith Memorial Chapel
Faith Memorial Chapel welcomes folks of all denominations to Sunday services at 
11:00 AM. They meet only in the summer with no membership roll, so you won't 
feel like a guest. Each Sunday features visiting clergy from different churches 
and great music.

This Sunday, August 17th, they welcome the Reverend Thomas C. Brown to lead 
their worship service and proclaim the gospel. Rev. Thomas "T" Brown is the 
Rector of St. Paul's Anglican Church in Greenville, South Carolina.

This Sunday, they also welcome Kelsie Barrineau. Kelsie is a rising senior at 
Furman University, studying Vocal Performance under Dr. Bronwen Forbay for a 
Bachelor's of Music as well as a minor in Linguistics. She is a soprano with 
a passion for singing Opera and Classical music. She currently sings as part 
of the Furman Singers Choir and the Sanctuary Choir of First Baptist Church 
of Greenville as a Choral Herring Scholar. That news is submitted by Earle Oxner.

### See Off Homesteaders Community Center
Greetings, neighbors and friends. As summer marches on, please join them for 
their August potluck this Sunday, August 17th.

Their program speaker will be Maury Bandurraga. It promises to be a very 
colorful program, as she tells them about how she grows and maintains beautiful 
Dahlias at their place in Slick Rock.

Bring a friend and bring your dish at 5:30 PM and they'll socialize for a bit 
before eating at 6:00 PM. Michael and Nancy Rosenthal, Dana Greenberg, and 
Lesin Dippold are their hosts for this potluck. Bring your own plates and 
utensils if you're of a mind to do so â€“ it reduces their contributions to the 
landfill.

If you haven't seen any of the videos of the work to rebuild/repair Becky 
Mountain Road that Heath Cowart and Melinda Hendershott have been making, you 
can see them online. The first one is after the storm and the others show 
several days in the life of the project. It's still scheduled to be open for 
traffic in early-mid October. They plan on having some sort of event to 
celebrate regaining this convenient way on and off their mountain, so watch 
for more info about it.

If you see work starting across from Holden cemetery on the land owned by 
Transylvania Habitat for Humanity, it's to start grading for two homes that 
will be built for families displaced by Hurricane Helene. They'll get word out 
when it's possible to go help build them and welcome the new neighbors to their 
community. In the meantime, Habitat has also started prep work on the Leviskia's 
house a little down from the Slick Rock mailbox row. That news is from Doug Poad.

### Support and Renewal at Terra Nova Center
The Terra Nova Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, is hosting a 
fundraiser Indian dinner and cultural event on August 23rd. Located on Reasonover 
Road in Cedar Mountain, the center sustained significant damage from Hurricane 
Helene, including building damage and over 100 fallen trees across the property. 
Your support is vital to clear and restore the trails for visitors, repair the 
cherished spaces, and to ensure the continued preservation of the 105-year-old 
chapel.

### Rocky Hill Baptist Church
**Singing Schools and Conventions** - Homecoming will be held on Sunday, August 24th 
at 10:30 AM. Their guest singers this year are brothers Travis, Justin, and 
Jared Burns and their father Jim Burns of South Carolina. They are leaders of 
music in their churches and descendants of Street Burns, one of the original 
trustees of Rocky Hill Baptist Church. Dr. Mike Whitson, also a descendant of 
Street Burns, will bring the message.

In the early 1900s, all day or week long singing schools were held in the 
mountain churches for young and old alike. These schools taught the "Rudiments 
of Music, Sight Singing, Ear Training, Voice Culture, Harmony and Composition, 
and Method of Teaching and Conducting." This description of the instruction was 
taken from a first-grade certificate of proficiency awarded to Miss Nellie Lee 
of Rocky Hill Baptist Church in Cedar Mountain in February of 1916 by the 
Eagle's Normal Musical Institute.

Interdenominational singing conventions of the county church choirs were also 
held with J.W. Burns of Cedar Mountain presiding over the competitions between 
the choirs. Mr. Burns also taught singing schools in the churches of the area. 
In May of 1921, an all-day open air singing for Carr's Hill, Glady Branch and 
Rocky Hill Baptist Churches was held at Connestee Falls with dinner on the 
grounds and another all-day singing was held on Easter Sunday of 1919 on the 
grounds of the Brevard Institute. Please join them in worship as they celebrate 
the 150th year of Rocky Hill Baptist Church. They, too, will have dinner on 
the grounds. That news is submitted by Patricia Stahl.

### Bear Wise Program
A "Bear Wise" program from NC Wildlife will be held at the Cedar Mountain 
Community Center on Saturday, August 30th at 2 o'clock. Hosted by the Sequoyah 
Woods Homeowners Association and the Community Center, the program is free and 
open to everyone.

AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young
The Cedar Mountain News broadcast can be seen on CMCTV at streamyard.com/i3pxgk6ysgzp 
this week and can also be seen at The Cedar Mountain Canteen website

Excellent program at the Cedar Mountain Community Center Tuesday night. Habitat 
for Humanity educated us on the things Habitat does to help people. More than 
I ever imagined. Thanks Habitat.

### Cedar Mountain Canteen Community Storytelling
The Cedar Mountain Canteen announces Community Storytelling on Friday, September 
26th from 6:30 to 8:00 PM, a year after Helene. Share your stories of love and 
community resilience. There will be a potluck dinner too.

As we near the one year anniversary of Hurricane Helene we hold in our hearts 
the love and community we experienced and continue to experience. The Canteen 
would not be open if it wasn't for all the volunteer labor, help and donations 
our community provided and continues to provide. We still have a lot to do to 
get back to where we were. We want to take a moment and celebrate how far we 
have come in the past year because of our community.

We are hosting an evening of storytelling on September 26th and a community 
potluck. We will be recording the stories and will share them on our Canteen 
TV station. Please join us and share your story and listen to others as we 
celebrate the strength and love of our precious village. With deep gratitude.

### New Hours and Story Corps Project
**Updated Hours**: We have new hours for Tuesday when we will be opening at 12:30 PM 
and closing at 7:00 PM. And on Saturdays we will be closing at 8:00 PM on nights 
when we don't have music.

**Story Corps Project**: For months we have been hosting the John Lewis book club 
using his book "Carry On." The book is full of chapters that range in length from 
half a page to 5 pages. We spent time talking about topics and hearing each other's 
stories. As a group we agreed we would love to hear more stories from those in our 
community. Also, we now have a live streaming "TV station" and have the expertise 
and equipment to capture and share stories.

We are using the DIY StoryCorps guidance as we navigate the project and we are at 
the point of training where we are asked to assemble our team. So we are. Are you 
interested in being a part of the team? Please let us know. You can email us at 
LittleEddyLLC@gmail.com.

We look forward to growing together.
