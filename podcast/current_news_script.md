**4. Cedar Mountain Canteen Community Storytelling**

The Cedar Mountain Canteen announces Community Storytelling on Friday, 
September 26 from 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm a year after Helene. Share your stories of 
love and community resilience. There will be a potluck dinner too.

As we near the one year anniversary of Hurricane Helene we hold in our hearts 
the love and community we experienced and continue to experience. The Canteen 
would not be open if it wasn't for all the volunteer labor, help and donations 
our community provided and continues to provide. We still have a lot to do to 
get back to where we were. We want to take a moment and celebrate how far we 
have come in the past year because of our community.

We will be recording the stories and will share them on our Canteen TV 
station. Please join us and share your story and listen to others as we 
celebrate the strength and love of our precious village. With deep gratitude, 
The Cedar Mountain Canteen, an employee-owned cooperative.

**5. Cedar Mountain Canteen Art Feature**

The Canteen is currently featuring the art of Cathryn Cooper. Cathryn works 
with collage on paper and canvas using assorted materials to create elaborate 
mixed media pieces. Her inspiration is derived from found objects, combining 
them as totems in collage.

More recently, returning to her roots of drawing, she is inspired by the light 
in North Carolina mountain landscapes. Her most recent work combines acrylic 
painting and graphite drawing.

The Canteen is fortunate to be showcasing Cathryn's art. She has been chosen 
as the featured artist for the year's Brevard Plein Air Festival.

This month the club meeting will be on the second and third Monday, September 
8th and September 15th. We will be meeting at the Cedar Mountain Community 
Center at 5:30 PM on September 8th. We are fortunate to have Mary Freudenberg, 
president of the Transylvania County Bird Club as our speaker for the meeting. 
The annual migration of birds that pass through Transylvania County is 
beginning. I am sure Mary can tell us a lot about the birds we can expect to 
see pass through on their flight South for their winter vacation. A potluck 
meal will follow the meeting. Hope to see you there. Our address is 
10630-10640 Greenville Highway in Cedar Mountain.

**9. Around the House by Linda Packer Young**

I labored on Labor Day. I've been working pulling weeds and unwanted plant life 
from my Mossary and it is a big job. The area in front of the porch has been 
so badly neglected I can't even pull out some of the "volunteer" trees. Some 
have trunks on them. I've finished about half the project and what I've done 
looks great. I have balance issues and have to sit on the ground to groom the 
moss. I just hope I can finish it before fall weather sets in. Where did 
summer go anyway?

**3. NC Debris Cleanup Update**

BREVARD, NC- In July, Transylvania County Commissioners is partnering with 
North Carolina Emergency Management on the remaining Helene debris removal 
needs for the county under the SMART program. SMART has secured contractors to 
begin debris removal. Last week, FEMA completed site assessments and provided 
determinations for the Private Property Debris Sites in the County.

FEMA provided the following criteria for eligibility for debris removal activities, such as clearance, removal, and disposal, are eligible if the removal is in the public interest based on whether the work:
• Eliminates immediate threats to lives, public health, and safety.
• Eliminates immediate threats of significant damage to improved public or private property

A total of 412 application packets were submitted in Transylvania County. The 
applications were reviewed for eligibility by FEMA with 212 being deemed 
eligible or eligible with conditions. Twenty-five properties will have debris 
removed starting this week, while 187 need additional documentation. 
One 
hundred eighty-five properties were deemed ineligible, but NCEM staff will 
visit these sites to gather additional information for appeals. Another 15 are possible applications
for demolitionor landslide services and will be contacted separately

Transylvania County residents may visit ncdebriscleanup.com, then click on 
Transylvania County, to apply for debris removal or to check the status of 
their application. Applications need to be made by September 19. Updates will 
be posted on our website www.transylvaniacounty.org.
