meetings are held at the Cedar Mountain Community Center.

The 1st meeting of October on the 6th will feature Kathy King, the Executive 
Director of the Transylvania Community Arts Council, as the speaker. A potluck

**10.** AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young

My honey labored all day long Saturday for the Cook-Off. He used a recipe from 
his Emeril Lagasse Gumbo recipe from his massive cookbook collection. It was hot 
and ready for the tasting but sadly he didn't get any votes. However Terie 
Girolamo's son raved about the Gumbo as being true New Orleans style Gumbo and 
he loved it. However said he voted for his mom as did I. She won first place. My 
honey was pleased with the praise from someone who appreciated his efforts. We do 
have a lot of Gumbo leftover to eat though. Ha.

**1.** STORY CORPS

For months we have been hosting the John Lewis book club using his book Carry 
On. The book is full of chapters that range in length from half a page to 5 
pages. We spent time talking about topics and hearing each others stories. As a 
group we agreed we would love to hear more stories from those in our community. 
Also, we now have a live streaming "TV station" and have the expertise and 
equipment to capture and share stories.

We are using the DIY StoryCorps guidance as we navigate the project and we are 
at the point of training where we are asked to assemble our team. So we are. 
Are you interested in being a part of the team? Please let us know. You can 
email us at LittleEddyLLC@gmail.com. We look forward to growing together.
