# Cedar Mountain Community Podcast Script

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Cedar Mountain Community Podcast. I'm your host, Tod Schmidt and I am happy to have Diane Lewis here with me as well.

We've got some great events and news to share from our beautiful mountain 
Community so let's dive into what's happening around Cedar Mountain.

Actually first I should apologize to Jill Whalen for misnaming her. Jill Whalen did these wonderful paintings behind us here and Julianne Hogarth did the wonderful paintings over there.

### Sherwood Forest Friends Summer Series
This Saturday, July 19th, the Sherwood Forest Friends Summer Series kicks off 
with "Gaia Herbs: Soil to Supplement." Free admission! Head over to the Robin 
Hood Barn at 7 p.m. where Kate Renner, Director of Farm Operations at Gaia Herbs, 
will dig into the history of the Gaia farm and its evolution.

Since 1997, Gaia Herbs has been rooted in Transylvania County as one of its 
largest employers and agricultural land steward of 350 acres. You'll discover 
what inspired them to become the first Regenerative Organic Certified farm in 
the Carolinas and learn about the migrant farm crews who've made operations 
possible over the decades.

Wine and water will be available for a donation starting at 6:30 p.m. There's 
also a silent auction for artwork and experiences, plus raffle baskets. All 
proceeds benefit the Allikas Scholarship for environmental education and arts 
preservation.

Coming up in the series: July 26th brings songs and stories with Josh Goforth, 
and August 9th features a journey through Western North Carolina with Chris 
Bainbridge. Details at Sherwoodforestfriends.org/events.

### Faith Memorial Chapel
Faith Memorial Chapel welcomes folks of all denominations to Sunday services at 
11:00 AM. They meet only in the summer with no membership roll, so you won't 
feel like a guest. Each Sunday features visiting clergy from different churches 
and great music.

This Sunday, July 20th, they welcome Reverend Kyle Matthews, Minister of Worship 
Arts at First Baptist Church in Greenville, South Carolina. They'll also have 
Rudy Polk as soloist - a talented tenor from Clinton, Mississippi who's studying 
vocal performance at the University of North Texas.

### Rocky Hill Baptist Vacation Bible School

middle school are invited. Contact Patty Stahl at 885-2498 for more information.

AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young
I’m getting serious about weeds and undesirable plants in the front yard.  Most of the yard is ferns and moss including an absolute forest of Maidenhair ferns but the area right in front is supposed to be Hostas and little more.  I planted a native whose name I don’t recall, but it is very invasive.  I’d spray them but don’t want to harm desirables.  So I have to sit on the ground and pull weeds.  I’m a picky weeder so it takes a lot of time.  Last Wednesday my left eyebrow met a bench when I tripped over a hose.  I am keeping a low profile until this shiner goes away.



## Cedar Mountain Canteen News

Arianna, one of the Canteen's bartenders and artist behind White Wolf Stone 
Creations. Join online or in person! You'll need a canvas, acrylic paints in
