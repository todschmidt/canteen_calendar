# Cedar Mountain Community Podcast Script - Current News

## Introduction
Hello and welcome back to the Cedar Mountain Community Podcast. I am Tod Schmidt, and we have some important updates and exciting events to share with you from our mountain community today.

## Cedar Mountain Community News

### Important Debris Cleanup Update

First up, we have an important community notice that came out on Monday, July 8th, 2025. 

As of Tuesday, July 8, County Manager Jaime Laughter and Emergency Management Director Kevin Shook met with state and federal teams to keep things moving on storm debris cleanup. Good news — funding is now available to support continued waterway and private property debris removal, including demolition services.

Teams from FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers are evaluating sites later this week, and 412 private property debris applications are under review. NCDOT has also hired a contractor to finish debris pickups along their roadways.

We should see another update next week, so stay tuned.

This is definitely something our community needs to stay informed about, so please pay attention to the details.

### Additional Community Updates  

The Cedar Mountain Fire/Rescue Department is looking for volunteers. If you would like to join the Fire Department, please fill out the forms on their website cmfr.org.

The fire department now has STARLINK internet coverage for emergency conditions.   

FD AUXILIARY MEMBERS NEEDED
Time spent can be as little or as much as an individual is comfortable with. In addition, High school National Honor Society Members can also earn hours by participating in CMFR Fund Raisers.  If you are interested in joining the Auxiliary, attend the next meeting on the first Tuesday of each month at 6 pm at CMFR or contact Miriam Pflug, Auxiliary President at 864-237-3648 or Samuel Tenenbaum, Vice President at 803-261-7966.

ROCKY HILL BAPTIST CHURCH (just down Greenville Hwy)

TRANSYLVANIA SHARES
Can you fix things?  We need you for our free Repair Cafe.
The Cedar Mountain Canteen and Transylvania Shares has partnered with WNC Repair Cafe to bring fix-it clinics to Transylvania County.  Our first clinic will be in September.  We need volunteers who can fix things like furniture, tools and appliances.  We also need folks who can sew and mend.  If you have skills and are willing to donate your time, please let us know.  We need a local community of fixers.  We know you are out there.

A reasonable ratio of volunteers to participants is essential for a successful repair event, and volunteers of all skill levels are greatly appreciated. Email Transylvania Shares at TransylvaniaShares@gmail.com if you are interested in helping.  Thank you!  Everything on this earth is supremely valuable.  Nothing is disposable.

COMING UP at CMCC  
Aug 12th Potluck, Sept 9th Potluck & Crockpot Cook-off, Oct 14th Potluck BBQ Fundraiser, and Thanksgiving Potluck November 11th.  Updates will be forthcoming.  

FAITH MEMORIAL CHAPEL welcomes folks of all denominations to our services, held on Sundays at 11:00 AM.  We meet only in the summer and have no membership roll, so you won’t feel like a guest.  Each Sunday, we have clergy from different churches that visit us to lead the service and we are blessed to also have great music to accompany the great message!

On July 13th, we welcome the Rev. Dr. Fred W. Andrea III.   Dr. Andrea has served previously as pastor of the Rock Creek Baptist Church in Westport, Indiana, the Augusta Heights Baptist Church in Greenville, South Carolina, and the First Baptist Church of Savannah, Georgia. 

Music this Sunday will be provided by Craig Price.  Bass-Baritone Craig Philip Price, a native of Gilbert, South Carolina, holds degrees in Voice Performance from Furman University and Manhattan School of Music, as well as a Doctor of Musical Arts degree from the University of South Carolina.

AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young
Well, some progress is being made.  As some of you might remember two households were combined into one stuffed one in the fall of 2021.  My honey brought a lot of things with him that we didn’t have room for and we had to store shop equipment in a storage unit.  After all this time we decided that a workshop was not going to happen in this small cabin.  Our favorite handyman agreed to take it all.  He is a woodworker and has a large shop where he can put these machines to good use.  We are going to work out a deal where he will do work for us in exchange.  I’m just glad to empty that storage unit.  

Helene took care of another storage unit we had in Cedar Mountain.  Nearly everything in it was destroyed by the flood including a “treasured” collection of cookbooks.  Only a few items were salvaged.  Que sera sera.

Please note that the deadline to submit articles for the Cedar Mountain News is Monday night.  If your contribution will be later you need to let me know.  Email cedarmountainnews@gmail.com with all community news.  Photos are welcome and need to be 900kb or more to be used in the paper.


## Cedar Mountain Canteen News

We’ve got live music, jams, potlucks, and even our own livestream station now. That’s right — Cedar Mountain Canteen TV is streaming shows straight from our backyard. Got a show idea? Let the team know. They’re all about community-made media.

Here’s what’s coming up:

Thursday, from 6 to 8 p.m., join Paddle for a Song Swap — acoustic, all genres, all instruments welcome. Just bring yourself and a tune or two to share.

Saturday afternoons, from 2 to 4 p.m., it’s the Bluegrass Jam led by Bruce Threlkeld. Whether you want to pick, grin, or just tap your feet, everyone’s welcome.

Every Sunday from 3 to 5 p.m., it’s the Mountain Music Jam — mostly old-time fiddle tunes and acoustic fun. Come play or just soak in the sound.

Monday, July 14th from 6:00-8:00

Join us for an evening of original music with Dustin Maxwell and host, Owen Grooms. Dustin has spent most of his life right here in Western North Carolina, and is known for his work with bands like The Shotgun Gypsies and Dust in the Wind. His songs are soulful, evocative, and rooted in real life experiences right here in the mountains.

We will also be hosting a community potluck dinner this evening and every Monday from 6–8 pm. Please bring a dish to share and your own non-disposable place setting. If you cannot bring food, for any reason, we are happy to feed you. We look forward to sharing a meal together.
