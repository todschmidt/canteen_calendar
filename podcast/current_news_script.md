**1.** TRANSYLVANIA SHARES FREE REPAIR CAFE

Are you skilled at fixing things? We need your help to staff our repair 
clinic! Everything we do is free and volunteer-based. We're ready to mend 
clothing, fix sewing machines, and repair household appliances, furniture, 
and tools. Whether you have a broken blender or skills with a screwdriver, 
the WNC Repair Cafe is all about neighbors helping neighbors and reducing 
waste.

The Cedar Mountain Canteen and Transylvania Shares have teamed up with WNC 
Repair Cafe to bring fix-it clinics to Transylvania County. Our first clinic 
will be held on Saturday, September 20th from 4:30 to 7:30pm at the Cedar 
Mountain Canteen. There are no reservations. You just show up. Please come 
to the potluck as well.

We're looking for volunteers who can repair furniture, tools, and appliances, 
as well as those who can sew and mend. If you have the skills and are willing 
to donate your time, we'd love to hear from you. We need a local community of 
fixers, and we know you're out there. Having a good ratio of volunteers to 
participants is key to a successful event, and we welcome volunteers of all 
skill levels. If you're interested in helping out, please email Transylvania 
Shares at TransylvaniaShares@gmail.com. Thank you for being part of this 
effort. Everything on this earth is incredibly valuable—nothing is disposable!

**7.** AROUND THE HOUSE by Linda Packer Young

Last Friday my honey paid a visit to Transylvania Regional Hospital via 
ambulance and was transferred to Mission on Saturday morning. They are doing a 
batter of tests and he is still awaiting an MRI as of Tuesday. He had what 
might have been a TIA (transient ischemic attack) but that has not been 
determined. More later. I apologize if I missed using anyone's news.

**1.** STORY CORPS - Friday September 26th

For months we have been hosting the John Lewis book club using his book Carry 
On. The book is full of chapters that range in length from half a page to 5 
pages. We spent time talking about topics and hearing each others stories. As a 
group we agreed we would love to hear more stories from those in our community. 
Also, we now have a live streaming "TV station" and have the expertise and 
equipment to capture and share stories.

We are using the DIY StoryCorps guidance as we navigate the project and we are 
at the point of training where we are asked to assemble our team. So we are. 
Are you interested in being a part of the team? Please let us know. You can 
email us at LittleEddyLLC@gmail.com. We look forward to growing together.
