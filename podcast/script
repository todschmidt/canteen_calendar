I'm your host, and today we've got some wonderful local news and events to share with you 
from around our beautiful mountain community.

CEDAR MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY NEWS

First up, mark your calendars for Monday, July 8th. 
Connestee Fire & Rescue is hosting a really special event at the Dunn's Rock Community Center 
on Connestee Road in Brevard. They're presenting Ron Chapman and his entertaining presentation 
called "Hillbilly Linguistics." 

This sounds like it's going to be both fun and educational - Ron's known for his entertaining 
tales and colorful songs as he takes folks on a folksy tour of the "mountain talk" that 
emerged from the diverse populations who settled in the Appalachians of Western North Carolina.

The event runs from 6:30 to 8:00 PM, and here's the great part - desserts, tableware, and 
beverages are all provided! 
There's a social hour and 50-50 drawing from 6:30 to 7:00, followed by a brief CFRA message, 
and then Ron Chapman takes the stage from 7:15 to 8:00. 
Everyone's welcome to bring a favorite snack or dessert to share if you'd like.

Looking ahead to Saturday, July 20th, the See Off Homesteaders will be holding their July 
Potluck at the See Off Homesteaders Community Center on Old Orchard Lane in Brevard. 
Doug Poad mentioned that more details will be coming out next week, so keep an eye out for those.

And here's some news we've all been waiting for - work is expected to start during July on 
rebuilding and repairing Becky Mountain Road. 
That's certainly something our community has been looking forward to for quite some time.

CEDAR MOUNTAIN CANTEEN NEWS

Now let's move on to what's happening at the Cedar Mountain Canteen.

If you're a music lover, you're in for a treat with their regular weekly programming:

🎵 THURSDAY EVENINGS (6 to 8 PM)
Song Swap with Scott and Karen of Paddle Faster. 
If you've got a song - or three - that you'd like to share, this is your chance. They welcome all acoustic genres and instruments, so don't be shy about bringing whatever you play.

🎵 SATURDAY AFTERNOONS (2 to 4 PM)
Bruce Threlkeld hosts a Bluegrass Jam. 
It's a great time for singing, picking, and grinning, and Bruce caters to musicians who love bluegrass music in both its traditional and non-traditional styles. Whether you're a seasoned player or just getting started, come on down and join the fun.

🎵 SUNDAY AFTERNOONS (3 to 5 PM)
Mountain Music Jam featuring acoustic old-time fiddle tunes. 
Different community members take turns leading, so you'll get a nice variety. Bring an instrument and jump in, or just sit back, listen, and enjoy the music.

🎵 MONDAY EVENINGS (6 to 8 PM)
Owen Grooms presents The Longshots. 
This group is something special - they're old friends who love playing rowdy traditional dance tunes at blazing fast speeds. You've got Haakon Oyen on fiddle, Zeb Gambill on guitar, Landon George on upright bass, and Owen Grooms on banjo. They've been playing together for years, and you can really hear that seamless groove they create together.

SPECIAL JULY 4TH WEEKEND EVENTS

Now, let me tell you about some special July 4th weekend events you won't want to miss:

🎆 SATURDAY, JULY 5TH (7 to 9 PM)
An evening of music featuring Petah Iah & The Mind Renewers, who play Latin Reggae. 
That should be a really unique and exciting performance.

🎆 SUNDAY, JULY 6TH (1:00 PM and 3:00 PM)
Cedar Mountain Fire and Rescue is hosting a Brisket Fundraiser right at the Canteen. 
They're serving up brisket, Greek salad, and baked potato. They'll also have vegan and kids' plates available, so there's something for everyone. It's a great way to support our local fire and rescue while enjoying some excellent food and the mix of reggae, bluegrass, and old-time music.

That wraps up our community news for today. 
As always, these events are what make our Cedar Mountain community so special - the music, the food, the fellowship, and the way we all come together to support each other.
