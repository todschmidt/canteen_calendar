### Belgium Waffle Ride

On 10/4 from 8:00am to 8:00pm The Belgium Waffle Ride will be rolling throughout Transylvania County
There will be a lot of traffic on Cascade Lake Road, Staton/DuPont Road and Reasonover Road so be awarded
of that. There will be lots of signs on the road and we will keep giving heads up as we get closer to 
the date.

On a related note, your host is hosting an aid station at DuPont Bike Retreat this year and could definitely
use volunteers for any part of that day for 2-4 hours ata  time, whatever time you can help.

Volunteers will get a t shirt, BWR water bottle, and a shwag bag for their time. Reach out to me, Tod Schmidt
at tschmidty@yahoo.com if you can help out that day, I would definitely appreciate it.
