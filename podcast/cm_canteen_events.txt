## Every other Friday, starting from 10/24/2025 - Storytelling hosted by George.
This is the third installment of our storytelling Fridays and this one’s theme is folklore. Join us as we explore the shadowy corners of the known world, share ghost stories, and weave some tall tales. All are welcome. Costumes are encouraged.

Threlkeld. Whether you want to pick, grin, or just tap your feet, everyone’s
welcome.

Every Sunday from 3 to 5 p.m., it’s the Mountain Music Jam — mostly old-time
fiddle tunes and acoustic fun. Come play or just soak in the sound.
