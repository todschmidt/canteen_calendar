In this context, we will be taking news items from the file news in this folder and generating a script to use as a guideline for reading off as a podcast. 

There will be a section for Cedar Mountain Community News, a section for Cedar Mountain Canteen News, and possibly other events after that.

The tone should be conversational and low key.

We should try to include all relevant information without repetition. 

Include days of the weeks and dates when providing a date. Only use the "news" file and not any files named news-yyyymmdd
