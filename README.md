- Export export-events.xml

Hello,
Thought I would send this to you because I am working on it now and didn't want to forget.

One thing that came out of the focus group meeting was for us to create a poster each month of our events.  Something like the attached.  Still lots of work to be done.

I am wondering if you could write a script that would eliminate me creating the schedule by hand.  I copied the data from the website and then spent a lot of time getting the data parsed down to the few fields for the poster.  We can download an xml file of the entire events calendar but I only need it for a month at a time and only the elements on the poster.

I have attached the xml file provided by Wordpress of events.

Would appreciate any thoughts.
Thanks!
Kim
