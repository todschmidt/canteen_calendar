# Podcast Infrastructure Setup - Terraform Project

## Project Overview
Setting up AWS infrastructure for podcast hosting with S3 storage, CloudFront distribution, and automated RSS feed generation.

## Infrastructure Components
- **S3 Bucket**: Storage for podcast audio files
- **CloudFront**: CDN with SSL and custom domain support
- **ACM Certificate**: SSL certificate for custom domain
- **Lambda Function**: RSS feed generation and management
- **Route53**: DNS management (if using custom domain)

---

## Phase 1: Storage & Static Hosting 🗂️

### 1.1 S3 Bucket Setup
- [ ] Create S3 bucket for podcast audio files
- [ ] Configure bucket versioning for rollback capability
- [ ] Set up bucket lifecycle policies (optional: transition to IA after X days)
- [ ] Configure bucket encryption (SSE-S3 or KMS)
- [ ] Set up bucket logging for access monitoring

### 1.2 S3 Security & Access Control
- [ ] Create bucket policy to restrict public access
- [ ] Set up Origin Access Identity (OAI) for CloudFront access
- [ ] Configure CORS if needed for web-based uploads
- [ ] Enable access logging for audit purposes

---

## Phase 2: Content Delivery & SSL 🔒

### 2.1 ACM Certificate
- [ ] Request SSL certificate in us-east-1 region (required for CloudFront)
- [ ] Validate certificate (DNS or email validation)
- [ ] Wait for certificate to be issued and validated

### 2.2 CloudFront Distribution
- [ ] Create CloudFront distribution pointing to S3 bucket
- [ ] Configure custom domain with ACM certificate
- [ ] Set up caching behaviors for audio files
- [ ] Configure error pages and redirects
- [ ] Set up custom headers if needed

### 2.3 Domain & DNS (Optional)
- [ ] Configure Route53 hosted zone if using custom domain
- [ ] Create A record alias pointing to CloudFront distribution
- [ ] Set up subdomain (e.g., media.example.com)

---

## Phase 3: RSS Feed Generation 📡

### 3.1 Lambda Function Setup
- [ ] Create Lambda function for RSS generation
- [ ] Set up IAM role with S3 read/write permissions
- [ ] Configure Lambda environment variables
- [ ] Set up Lambda layers if needed (e.g., for ID3 tag reading)

### 3.2 RSS Generation Logic
- [ ] Implement RSS 2.0 XML generation
- [ ] Add required podcast tags:
  - [ ] `<title>`, `<link>`, `<description>`
  - [ ] `<itunes:title>`, `<itunes:description>`, `<itunes:author>`
  - [ ] `<enclosure>` tags with audio file URLs
  - [ ] `<pubDate>` and `<guid>` for each episode
- [ ] Handle episode metadata extraction (ID3 tags)
- [ ] Generate unique episode GUIDs

### 3.3 Automation Triggers
- [ ] Set up S3 event triggers for Lambda execution
- [ ] Configure CloudWatch Events for scheduled RSS updates
- [ ] Handle both PUT and DELETE events for feed maintenance

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation ✅

### 4.1 Infrastructure Testing
- [ ] Test S3 bucket access and file uploads
- [ ] Verify CloudFront distribution is working
- [ ] Test SSL certificate and HTTPS access
- [ ] Validate custom domain resolution

### 4.2 RSS Feed Testing
- [ ] Test RSS feed generation with sample audio files
- [ ] Validate RSS 2.0 compliance
- [ ] Test podcast app compatibility (Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.)
- [ ] Verify enclosure URLs are accessible via HTTPS

### 4.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] Test CloudFront caching behavior
- [ ] Monitor Lambda execution times
- [ ] Test RSS generation with large numbers of episodes

---

## Phase 5: Publishing & Distribution 📢

### 5.1 Feed Submission
- [ ] Submit RSS feed URL to Apple Podcasts
- [ ] Submit to Spotify for Podcasters
- [ ] Submit to Google Podcasts
- [ ] Submit to other podcast platforms as needed

### 5.2 Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms for Lambda errors
- [ ] Monitor S3 bucket usage and costs
- [ ] Set up logging and alerting for RSS generation failures
- [ ] Create runbook for troubleshooting common issues

---

## Phase 6: Optional Enhancements 🚀

### 6.1 Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement automatic episode metadata extraction from ID3 tags
- [ ] Add transcoding capabilities with AWS MediaConvert
- [ ] Set up episode analytics tracking
- [ ] Implement automatic episode numbering

### 6.2 Cost Optimization
- [ ] Set up S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- [ ] Configure CloudFront price classes
- [ ] Monitor and optimize Lambda execution costs
- [ ] Set up cost alerts and budgets

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Set up Terraform backend configuration (S3 backend as mentioned in .cursorrules)
2. [ ] Create basic Terraform configuration files
3. [ ] Start with S3 bucket module
4. [ ] Progress through phases systematically

## Notes
- All AWS resources will be created in the specified region
- S3 backend will be used for Terraform state management
- Consider using Terraform workspaces for environment separation
- Document all variables and outputs for team collaboration
